Tips for using GitHub for organizing research<br>
Thank you to YorkU for providing a workshop on this! https://yorkulibraries-ds.github.io/carpentries-rr-vc/ 

## About me
<b>Name:</b> Janice Lam

<b>What do I research?</b> Equity, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace; more specifically, my current research projects consider how one's identity (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) affects their own and others' perceptions and reactions in the workplace. 

<b>How do I conduct my research?</b> Coming from a psychology background, I use both quantitative (e.g., experiments, surveys) and qualitative (e.g, interviews) methods. 

## What is the point of this README?
So people may know who is behind this. Also, this allows me to practice using markdown and html. </p>
